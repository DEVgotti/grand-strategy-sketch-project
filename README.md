# Grand Strategy Project

Learning project in which the goal is to simulate a grand strategy game. This simulation aims to mimic troop movements and the construction of different buildings in each province.

This project is NOT intended to be a PLAYABLE game, as it will not have persistence or an AI to play against.

This project only aims to learn vanilla javascript and the use of libraries to accomplish an objective.
